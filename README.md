# EDM-Sound-Design-Element-Matcher

This is a Python tool that randomly generates different musical sounds + sound-design methods & effects. It can be used to aid in pioneering new sounds.

The element data are stored in JSON format in a JSON file. The Python script parses the JSON objects and randomly picks.

Current categories:
- Instrument
- Effects
- Envelope
- Composition Structures

Each category can also have subcategories, and if the program picks one subcategory, it makes a note and steps into the subcategories for a more detailed choice.
